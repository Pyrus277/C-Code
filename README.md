# C-Code
Code for self-reference as I learn C 

Primary resource for now is the textbook "C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N. King, and the chapter folders refer to this book. 
Exercises are denoted with an "e" in the filename, and projects with a "p." For example. ch2p2.c is project 2 from chapter 2.
